compile with gdb trace:
    gcc -g -o hello hello.c
Debug program:
    cgbd hello
    
How do you pass command line arguments to a program when using gdb? 
    - run arglist
How do you set a breakpoint which only occurs when a set of conditions is true (e.g. when certain variables are a certain value)?
    - break <line_nr> if ch=='o'
How do you execute the next line of C code in the program after stopping at a breakpoint?
    - by pressing n
If the next line of code is a function call, you'll execute the whole function call at once if you use your answer to #3. How do you tell GDB that you want to debug the code inside the function instead?
    - by pressing s
How do you resume the program after stopping at a breakpoint?
    - by pressing c
How can you see the value of a variable (or even an expression like 1+2) in gdb?
    - print variable_name
How do you configure gdb so it prints the value of a variable after every step?
    - display variable_name
How do you print a list of all variables and their values in the current function?
    - info locals
How do you exit out of gdb?
    - exit
